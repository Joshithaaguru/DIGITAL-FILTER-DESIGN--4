Design and Simulation of a Digital FIR Filter Using Verilog or MATLAB

The objective of this project is to design and simulate a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filter using Verilog or MATLAB. FIR filters are widely used in digital signal processing (DSP) applications due to their inherent stability and linear phase characteristics. This project aims to provide hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and analyzing the performance of a digital FIR filter.

Project Overview:

The FIR filter will be designed to meet specific frequency response requirements, such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or band-stop filtering. MATLAB will be used for filter coefficient generation using design methods such as Windowing, Frequency Sampling, or Optimal Filter Design. Alternatively, the filter can be implemented and simulated directly using Verilog for hardware description and FPGA deployment.

Key Objectives:

1. Filter Design: Design an FIR filter with a given filter order, cutoff frequency, and sampling frequency.


2. Implementation: Write the Verilog code for the FIR filter architecture, or use MATLAB scripts to simulate its functionality.


3. Simulation: Validate the design through simulations, analyzing time-domain and frequency-domain responses.


4. Performance Analysis: Assess key parameters like Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Frequency Response, and Group Delay.


5. Optimization: Optimize resource usage (e.g., multipliers, adders) for FPGA-based implementations if using Verilog.



Deliverables:

Verilog Code or MATLAB Script for the FIR filter.

Simulation Results: Waveform outputs, frequency response plots, and verification results.

Performance Analysis Report: Detailed evaluation of filter characteristics and performance metrics.


This project bridges theoretical concepts with practical implementation, preparing participants for real-world DSP and FPGA-based projects. A Completion Certificate will be awarded at the end of the internship, acknowledging the successful design, simulation, and analysis of the FIR filter.
